# Goal
- Our project is focused on agriculture. The price fluctuations of agricultural products affects a countryâ€™s GDP. Hence, crop evaluation is suggestable before farming a specific type of crop. Our model helps to minimize the loss and aims to help the farmers benefit from crop prediction to make better informed financial decisions. With the help of a dashboard we hope to help in suggesting the farmers with better solutions for profitable cultivation. 
- Crop selection based on soil, climate, geography of the region and the type of crop are some things which we intend to dive deep into.


# Background  

Our team will use the crops data to build our base recommendation model and dashboard to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters. We found a paper online which tells us how different factors could affect the yield of crops. Next, we will refine our model by adding the factors from paper and also adding more crop data from different areas to let it have more customized functionalities and be able to give professional crop recommendations for farmers outside of India. 

# Data

Data found on Kaggle at the link below:

## Data security

Data is found publically on the internet.

## Counts

Our dataset describes soil and weather conditions as well as a label for the crop determined to be most suitable to be grown in those conditions. The data is well-balanced, containing the same number of rows for each of the 22 crops, and the other columns describe macronutrient levels of Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium in the soil, average temperature, average humidity, and total rainfall of the growing location over the growing season. This data was collected in India and provided by the Indian Chamber for Food and Agriculture.

# Models

Our target column is the crop reccomendation, which we use to estimate percent yield.
